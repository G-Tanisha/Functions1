What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","   - Difference between a Function and a Method in Python: In Python, both functions and methods are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. However, they differ primarily in their definition and context of use.\n","   Function: A function is a self-contained block of code that is defined using the def keyword. It is not associated with any class or object. Functions can be called independently and are used to perform operations that are not specific to any object. They can accept parameters and return values.\n","   Method: A method is similar to a function but is always associated with a class. It is defined within a class and is meant to operate on instances (objects) of that class. Methods implicitly take the instance (self) as their first parameter, allowing them to access and modify the object’s attributes.\n","   In summary, the key difference lies in the context in which they are defined and used: functions are independent, whereas methods are dependent on object instances and classes.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","   - Function Arguments and Parameters in Python\n","   In Python, parameters are the variable names defined in a function’s definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n","   Parameters act as placeholders for input data, allowing functions to process different values.\n","   Arguments provide those actual input values during a function call.\n","   Types of Arguments:\n","   Positional Arguments – Passed in the same order as parameters.\n","   Keyword Arguments – Passed using parameter names.\n","   Default Arguments – Parameters with default values.\n","   Variable-length Arguments – Allow passing multiple values.\n","\n","3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","   - In Python, functions can be defined and called in multiple ways depending on how inputs are passed and handled.\n","   Ways to Define a Function:\n","   1. Standard Function (with or without parameters):\n","   def greet():\n","    print(\"Hello\")\n","    def greet(name):\n","    print(\"Hello,\", name)\n","  2.Function with Default Parameters:\n","  def greet(name=\"User\"):\n","    print(\"Hello,\", name)\n","  3.Function with Variable-length Arguments:\n","  def greet(*names):\n","    for name in names:\n","        print(\"Hello,\", name)\n","  4.Lambda Function (anonymous function):\n","  square = lambda x: x * x\n","  \n","  Ways to Call a Function:\n","  1. Using Positional Arguments:\n","  greet(\"Tanisha\")\n","  2. Using Keyword Arguments:\n","  greet(name=\"Tanisha\")\n","  3. Using Default Argument (by skipping it):\n","  greet()  # Uses default value\n","  4. **Using *args or kwargs:\n","  greet(\"Tanisha\", \"Rahul\", \"Aryan\")\n","  \n","  Functions in Python can be defined using def or lambda, with or without parameters. They can be called using positional, keyword, default, or variable-length arguments depending on how they are defined.\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n","   - Purpose of the return Statement in a Python Function\n","   The return statement in Python is used to send back a value from a function to the place where the function was called. It ends the function's execution and optionally provides a result.\n","   Key Points:\n","   It terminates the function.\n","   It returns a value (or multiple values) to the caller.\n","   If no return is used, the function returns None by default.\n","\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","   - In Python, iterators and iterables are related concepts used in looping and data processing, but they are not the same.\n","   Iterable:\n","   An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its elements one at a time. It implements the __iter__() method. Examples include lists, strings, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.\n","   You can loop over an iterable using a for loop.\n","\n","   Iterator:\n","   An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data; it produces the next value each time you call next() on it. It implements both __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n","   You can get an iterator from an iterable using the iter() function.\n","\n","   Key Differences:\n","   An iterable can be looped over, but does not generate values by itself.\n","   An iterator is created from an iterable and can generate the next value on demand.\n","   Iterators maintain their state (current position), while iterables do not.\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","   - Concept of Generators in Python\n","   A generator in Python is a special type of function that allows you to generate values one at a time, instead of computing and storing all values at once. It is useful for handling large datasets or infinite sequences efficiently.\n","   \n","   How Generators Work:\n","   Generators use the yield keyword instead of return.\n","   Each time the generator function is called using next(), it resumes from where it left off.\n","   Generators maintain their internal state, unlike regular functions.\n","   \n","   Defining a Generator:\n","   A generator is defined like a normal function but uses yield to return values.\n","   def count_up_to(n):\n","    count = 1\n","    while count <= n:\n","        yield count\n","        count += 1\n","   Key Features:\n","   Memory-efficient: Does not store all values in memory.\n","   Lazy evaluation: Values are produced only when needed.\n","   Used in loops: Often used in for loops for better performance.\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","   - Advantages of Using Generators Over Regular Functions in Python\n","   Generators provide several benefits, especially when working with large or complex data. Here are the key advantages:\n","   1. Memory Efficiency\n","   Generators do not store the entire sequence in memory. They generate values one at a time, which is useful when handling large datasets or infinite sequences.\n","   \n","   2. Lazy Evaluation\n","   Generators use lazy evaluation, meaning values are computed only when needed. This improves performance and reduces unnecessary calculations.\n","   \n","   3. Simpler Code for Iteration\n","   Using yield makes it easier to write iterators without manually handling the state and __next__() or __iter__() methods.\n","   \n","   4. Improved Performance\n","   Since generators do not build entire lists in memory, they can be faster and more responsive, especially in loops or pipelines.\n","   \n","   5. Supports Infinite Sequences\n","   Generators can model infinite sequences (like streaming data) because they produce values on demand without exhausting system resources.\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","   - Lambda Function in Python\n","   A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous (unnamed) function defined using the lambda keyword. It can have any number of parameters, but only one expression.\n","\n","   When Is It Typically Used?\n","   Lambda functions are typically used when:\n","   1. A short, simple function is needed temporarily.\n","   2. Used as an argument to functions like map(), filter(), or sorted().\n","   3. Used inline to avoid formally defining a full function with def.\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n","   -Usage of the map() Function in Python\n","   The map() function in Python is used to apply a function to every item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and return a new iterator with the results.\n","   Purpose:\n","   1. To transform each element of an iterable using a given function.\n","   2. It helps in writing cleaner and more concise code for element-wise operations.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","    - 1. map()\n","      Purpose: Applies a function to each element in an iterable and returns a new iterable (map object).\n","      Returns: Transformed items, one by one.\n","      Usage:\n","      map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])  # → [2, 4, 6]\n","      2. filter()\n","      Purpose: Applies a function that returns True or False to each element, and returns only those elements that satisfy the condition.\n","      Returns: Filtered items.\n","      Usage:\n","      filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # → [2, 4]\n","      3. reduce()\n","      Purpose: Applies a function cumulatively to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n","      Returns: One result after processing all elements.\n","      Usage:\n","      reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # → 10\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","  \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","  \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fgO4WQtbhQzK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''1.
